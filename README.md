## Features

***Support for Flutter and dart***

- Adds three shortcuts to insert semicolons with ease;
- Depends on comma position in line. If there is comma before close bracket (,) put a comma end of the line otherwise puts a semicolon.

  - <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> Insert semicolon at the end of line and continue on the same line
  - <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> Insert semicolon at the end of line and continue on the new line
  - <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> Insert semicolon and stay at the same position

- First accepts autocomplete suggestion if one is present and then does its job

> Note: If line contains semicolon cursor will still move
